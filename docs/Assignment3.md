# CS411 Lab Team Assignment 3
## Project Requirements
1 Oauth <br>
2 API <br>
Database <br>
Front/Back-end <br>

## Technology Stacks Chosen
- 1 Oauth: Discord Oauth2
- 2 API: OpenAI, Genius API
- Database: sqlite
- Front End: React
- Back-end: Next.js

## Why Chose These Stacks?
For the front-end and back-end requirements, I chose to use React and Next.js respectively. React is a popular and well-documented library for building dynamic user interfaces, while Next.js is a powerful framework that allows us to build server-side-rendered applications with ease. Using these two technologies together allows for easy and efficient development of a full-stack web application.

We are going to be using t3app for this project. The t3app is a web application framework that is built on top of Next.js and provides a set of pre-configured tools and components for building full-stack web applications. It has a great base features such as authentication, database integration, and routing, etc.
